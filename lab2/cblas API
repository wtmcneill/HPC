cblas_dgemm

Multiplies two matrices (double-precision).

void cblas_dgemm (
 const enum CBLAS_ORDER Order,
 const enum CBLAS_TRANSPOSE TransA,
 const enum CBLAS_TRANSPOSE TransB,
 const int M,

 const int K,
 const double alpha,
 const double *A,

);
Parameters

Order
Specifies row-major (C) or column-major (Fortran) data ordering.

TransA
Specifies whether to transpose matrix A.

TransB
Specifies whether to transpose matrix B.

M
Number of rows in matrices A and C.

N
Number of columns in matrices B and C.

K
Number of columns in matrix A; number of rows in matrix B.

alpha
Scaling factor for the product of matrices A and B.

A
Matrix A.

lda
The size of the first dimention of matrix A; if you are passing a matrix A[m][n], the value should be m.

B
Matrix B.

ldb
The size of the first dimention of matrix B; if you are passing a matrix B[m][n], the value should be m.

beta
Scaling factor for matrix C.

C
Matrix C.

ldc
The size of the first dimention of matrix C; if you are passing a matrix C[m][n], the value should be m.

Discussion

This function multiplies A * B and multiplies the resulting matrix by alpha. It then multiplies matrix C by beta. It stores the sum of these two products in matrix C.

Thus, it calculates either

C←αAB + βC

or

C←αBA + βC

with optional use of transposed forms of A, B, or both.
